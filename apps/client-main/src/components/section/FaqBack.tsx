      question:
        "What is the estimated time it will take to build a full house",
      answer:
        "It takes 6 to 14 months to complete a house construction project. Generally, a 5-month period to build the first floor and 1.5 months for each one after that is the standard. However, this depends on the space, built-up area, locations, design, construction type (foundation or core), etc. You can track your project, including updates, inspection reports, payment schedules, etc., on the customer app.",

    {
      question: "Do I have to pay the full amount before the project starts",
      answer:
        "Payments are structured in stages based on a personalised schedule that aligns with your project's construction phases and overall cost. The process begins with an 8% booking amount, which covers the entire design phase, including soil testing, digital surveys, 2D floor plans, structural drawings, MEP drawings, and 3D elevation. <br /><br /> After the design phase is complete, the finalised plan is handed over to the project management team, and mobilisation at the site is initiated. Subsequent payments are made in stages, corresponding to specific milestones in the construction process",

      question:
        "What to consider when analysing the quotation by a home builder or construction contractor",
      answer:
        "Donâ€™t compare the cost just on the sqft rate. Check detailed Specifications. Like for Car shopping, You don't just ask the price, right? You check the engine, build, maintenance, etc. Local home Builders give you the Handoff Numbers while being silent on the specification used. We at Brix Homes give us an extensive 70+ specification document . Check out our Construction Cost Calculator to get exact cost with detailed specification.",
